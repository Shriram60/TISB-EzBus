EzBus is a new and effective way of transport in a smaller area in which a bus or any other means of public transport will move from station to station based on peopleâ€™s needs and will be more efficient and user-friendly than the current means of public transport.\n

Developed in Java using JavaFX by 'ThatOneTeam' - Saahil, Siddharth and Shriram\n\n

This is a simulation that showcases the idea with a simplified map and assuming equidistant intersections\n\n
Run the file Visuals\n
->There are 5 'stations' (in white) These function as both pickup/drop locations\n
->Out of these stations that are shown in green are pickup locations\n
->The stations shown in red are drop locations\n
-> The moving yellow dot shows the current location of the bus\n
->Outputs on console show when the system is ready and gives details about the pickup calls and bus destination\n\n

The program will take some time to actually show the visuals/console. Please be patient. This is caused by the initialisation of the sound system\n
It may take some time for the bus to start moving as the location and time of pickup requests is random, as is where the picked up people want to go.\n
